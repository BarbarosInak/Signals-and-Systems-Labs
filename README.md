# Signals-and-Systems-Labs
In this repository, I am going to share the codes that I have written for the Signals and Systems lecture. Which is the lecture that I have taken during my bachelor's degree, which is Electronics and Communication Engineering, at the İzmir Institute of Technology(IZTECH / İYTE).

-LAB 1-
-------

Finding given functions are even or odd by examining mathematical methods.

-LAB 2-
-------

Performing a manual convolution operation and then comaring the results with MATLAB's convolution function.

-LAB 3-
-------

In lab 3 we investigated Fourier Series Coefficients and Parseval's Relation.

-LAB 4-
-------

Lab 4 made us to investigate the Gibbs Phenomenon by using Fourier Series Coefficients.

-LAB 5-
-------

In 5.1 we obtained a Fourier transform manually and in the second part of the 5th lab Impulse Response of the system have been calculated by using the Fourier transform, which have been calculated in 5.1. 

-LAB 6-
-------

In the sixth lab, first we created Low-Pass Filter, Band-Pass Filter and High-Pass Filter. After that by using freqz() function we applied the created filters to the sample signal. Finally, we designed ideal filters to compare the created nonideal filters(fripm in our case). 

-LAB 7-
-------

In the final lab, we investigated the effect of the different downsampling periods' on the quality of the original signal after applying upsampling to downsampled signal.
